# The Kata is inspired by Calculating with Functions Kata for JavaScript.

# The goal is to implement simple calculator which uses fluent syntax:

# Calc.new.one.plus.two             # Should return 3
# Calc.new.five.minus.six           # Should return -1
# Calc.new.seven.times.two          # Should return 14
# Calc.new.nine.divided_by.three     # Should return 3
# There are only four operations that are supported (plus, minus, times, divided_by) and 10 digits (zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine).

# Each calculation consists of one operation only.
